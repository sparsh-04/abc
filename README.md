Introduction
Globalization refers to the process of increasing international interconnectedness through the exchange of ideas, cultures, and products across the world. One industry that has been undergoing significant changes over the past few years due to globalization is the food industry. The food industry has become more interconnected, and food production and distribution systems have become more globalized.
Increased availability of varying food products from all over the globe is one of the most significant impacts of globalization on the food industry. Consumers now have access to various food options, including exotic and culturally specific foods that were once difficult to find. The food industry's globalization has increased competition, innovation, and diversity in the marketplace.
MasterChef is one such cooking competition TV show that has transformed the food industry. The show started in the UK in 1990 and has since been adapted in over 60 countries, making it one of the most successful reality TV franchises. Bringing together amateur and professional chefs to compete against each other in a series of culinary challenges, the show's popularity has not only led to the emergence of many talented chefs. Still, it has also significantly impacted the food industry. 
The show has transformed how people approach food, from home cooking to fine dining, and influenced the restaurant industry's trends. The show's global reach has also promoted diverse food cultures and cuisines, leading to a more extensive appreciation of different culinary traditions. This project report will explore how MasterChef has transformed the food industry forever, from creating new food trends to changing how we think about food.










History of MasterChef
MasterChef is a competitive cooking show television format created by Franc Roddam, which originated with the UK version in July 1990. The format was revived and updated for the BBC in February 2005 by executive producers Roddam and John Silver with series producer Karen Ross. (Roddam)
What goes into organizing MasterChef
The structure of MasterChef varies based on the specific version of the show. In the primary MasterChef series, many aspiring cooks from all over the UK participate in initial rounds, presenting a dish to the judges to secure a spot in the semi-finals. Those who attend the semi-finals face challenges designed to test their culinary knowledge and skills. Through individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly eliminations, the contestants are gradually narrowed down until a winner is crowned.
On the other hand, "MasterChef: The Professionals" - pits professional chefs against one another in various cooking challenges. Celebrity MasterChef features famous individuals as contestants, while Junior MasterChef is designed for young cooks between nine and twelve.
MasterChef UK has different challenges for each season to give the audience novelty every time. Some examples of challenges include:
"The Market Test: The participants invent a dish using ingredients from the show's market. They have to select ingredients and then cook the meal." This test keeps the audience interested as they watch contestants perform and struggle with different ingredients and what they can make out of them. ("MasterChef (British TV series)")
"The Impression Test: The contestants cook a two-course meal for the past winners and finalists of MasterChef. They are given one hour to serve the main course and 15 minutes afterward to serve dessert. This segment was first featured in 2017". This makes the audience nostalgic as they revisit past winners and get to see them again. ("MasterChef (British TV series)")
"The Calling Card: The contestants invent a dish from scratch. The contestants choose any ingredients they like." This test makes the audience invested in the episode until the end, as they still determine what the contestants will cook. ("MasterChef (British TV series)")
"The Invention Test: The contestants are given two boxes: one with sweet items and the other with savory items. They must pick a box and make a dish using its ingredients within 75 minutes." The contestants choose one of them and make something unique out of it. ("MasterChef (British TV series)")
"The Palate Test: The judge cooks a dish for the contestants, and participants must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the available ingredients." This test is a unique concept as they have to reverse engineer the dish and try to make the same one, which is quite a novel concept. ("MasterChef (British TV series)")
"The Choice Test: The contestants have 80 minutes to create a show-stopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic". ("MasterChef (British TV series)")
During "Comeback Week," which takes place in the sixth week of the show, contestants from previous seasons of MasterChef who were eliminated before the heats or quarter-finals are given another chance to compete. The format of the show changes during this special week. For example:
"The Skill Test: Contestants are given 25 minutes to prepare one of the two recipes. Some contestants are eliminated after this round, which is a basic screening process." ("MasterChef (British TV series)")
The Pressure Test: Contestants work at a busy restaurant in a lunchtime shift under a professional chef who provides feedback about their performance. This challenge adds an element of realism to the show as contestants must prepare dishes in a real-life restaurant setting.
These rounds make the audience still interested as they visit previous contestants, and if they liked someone, they know they can see them again.
All these reasons play a synergistic role and help MasterChef achieve new heights.


MasterChef Effect 
Masterchef has helped many homemakers and amateur cooks to rise to national fame. The ever-growing interest of the people after Masterchef started airing has helped to recover the food industry, with approximately 13 million users watching it.MasterChef presents the food industry to its participants and viewers as an alluring aspiration rather than a challenging path toward a career in culinary arts. “MasterChef offers both the contestants and audiences a view of the food industry in which the prospect of a culinary career is positioned as an enticing dream rather than a complicated pathway.” (“Do TV cookery programs really influence the way we cook?”)

If we look at the history of its effect, In early 2009’s, the great financial crisis saw people moving from going to restaurants to cooking in their homes due to a constraint in their pocket size”.IBISWorld, established in 1971, offers dependable research on numerous industries globally. “IBISWorld General Manager Robert Bryant said, “That’s changing, with the restaurant trade expected to show modest growth ahead of a dining boom through the next five years. The days of the country’s eateries stomaching a slow economy are over.” added Mr. Bryant” (Hunter). The catering industry is also expected to grow, thanks to Masterchef. Despite shrinking in the 2009-10 period, the food services industry can expect their Customers’ budget to grow - mainly private citizens and deep-pocketed corporates, with some contribution to this growth by Masterchef. According to a report by IBISWorld, it predicts that this industry would see an increase of 20.7 % in the next five years and a growth of 3.5% by the very next year”.

With a primary focus on fine food and its ingredients, Australians, in particular, have developed a taste for gourmet foods. Coles, a significant sponsor of MasterChef that has heavily advertised during the show, has observed a 1400% increase in the sales of their "unusual" ingredients as soon as they are showcased in a MasterChef recipe. Research shows that the gourmet food industry's net worth will be around 5.5 billion dollars by the end of 2015.

Masterchef has affected not only the food industry but also the publishing or reading industry. With its first two editions sold out already and the 3rd one selling hot - the ‘MasterChef Magazine’ demonstrates Australians’ good taste in the food industry where they are not only trying and making these new things but also like to read what’s new related to MasterChef.Despite the struggling sector, cookbooks are emerging as one of the most successful segments, with a projected increase of 13 percent in cookbook sales to $200 million in 2010-2011, according to IBISWorld.

Some things that make MasterChef distinct from others are - 
It teaches us so much about food. It highlights how fast it has changed people's thoughts about food and cooking as a hobby, especially as a profession.
It encourages the contestants to experiment with different ingredients and create new methods and techniques.
MasterChef contestants are judged not only on their dishes' taste but also on their appearance. This has resulted in a greater emphasis on the visual appeal of food.
MasterChef provides an excellent forum for emphasizing the significance of culinary technique. The show imparts a comprehensive array of cooking methods to its participants, from fundamental proficiencies to more sophisticated approaches. This has had a positive impact on elevating the overall level of cooking proficiency.
The significance of using quality ingredients is a topic of discussion in MasterChef, which has helped to increase awareness about the importance of utilizing fresh and high-quality ingredients. As a result, there has been a greater focus on using locally sourced and seasonal produce.
The importance of having passion and dedication in cooking is emphasized in MasterChef, where contestants exhibit a deep love for food and a strong willingness to put in the effort required to craft flawless dishes. This has served as a source of inspiration for a new generation of home cooks, motivating them to elevate their cooking skills.

The rippling MasterChef effect is never-ending. According to Mr. Bryant, the country's new food enthusiasts are expected to seek out high-quality food, leading to potential financial gains for various entities such as cooking schools, kitchenware retailers, and top-end restaurants whose chefs may set challenging tasks for contestants. The list of these entities is extensive.

In conclusion, MasterChef has had a significant impact on the way people think about food and cooking. The show has encouraged creativity, highlighted the importance of presentation, taught valuable techniques, raised awareness of quality ingredients, and inspired a new generation of passionate home cooks.

Local food shows vs. MasterChef
Television being an integral part of our childhood as a source of entertainment, has also been a medium to many others as a knowledgeable source. One such domain is the cookery shows. Food shows have been impacting local and global households since their streaming. Local food shows and MasterChef have had different effects on the food industry throughout their streams. Few such ways they differ:
1.   	Audience: Local food shows tend to have a more niche audience, often catering to a specific region or demographic. MasterChef, on the other hand, has a much larger and more diverse audience, with versions of the show airing in over 60 countries.
2.  Cooking Style: Regional cooking programmes often focus on regional or traditional cuisine, while MasterChef emphasises creativity and innovation.
3.  Impact on the restaurant industry: Local food shows can boost the profile of local restaurants and food producers, while MasterChef has been shown to increase demand for culinary education and boost sales of kitchen equipment and ingredients.
4.   Impact on home cooking: MasterChef has been accredited with inspiring viewers to cook more at home and try new recipes, while local food shows may provide more practical instructions, sales promotion and recipes for everyday home cooks.
5.  	Format: Local food shows usually follow a specific format, such as a cooking demonstration, a food competition, or a travelogue. MasterChef, on the other hand, combines elements of all these formats, featuring cooking challenges, elimination rounds, and travel segments.
6.   Scope: Local food shows tend to focus on the local cuisine and food culture of a specific region or country. MasterChef, in contrast, has more global scope, featuring a wide range of international cuisines and cooking styles.
7.      Contestants: Local food shows often feature professional chefs, home cooks, or food experts as their contestants. MasterChef, however, is open to amateur home cooks from all walks of life, making it more accessible to a wider audience.
8.      Judging: Local food shows often have a panel of judges who are experts in the local cuisine or food culture. MasterChef, in contrast, has a panel of judges who are typically well-known chefs or restaurateurs with a broad range of culinary expertise.
9.      Production values: MasterChef is a high-budget production that features lavish sets, professional camera work, and high-quality editing. Local food shows may have lower production values but can still offer engaging content and useful information for food lovers.
Even though local food shows have been showing localization, there have been a few instances where it has inherited glocalization. A few such instances are:
1.      In an episode of the British cooking show "Saturday Kitchen," celebrity chef Ken Hom demonstrated how to make a traditional Chinese stir-fry dish called kung pao chicken. (Source: BBC, https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/kung_pao_chicken_47947)
2.      In an episode of the Australian cooking show "Better Homes and Gardens," celebrity chef Fast Ed created a Mexican-inspired dish of grilled beef fajitas with homemade guacamole. (Source: Better Homes and Gardens, https://www.bhg.com.au/fast-ed-s-beef-fajitas-with-guacamole)
3.      In an episode of the Indian cooking show "MasterChef India," the contestants were challenged to create dishes inspired by international cuisine. One contestant made a Japanese-inspired dish of sushi rolls with a twist, using Indian spices and flavours. (Source: Indian Express, https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/masterchef-india-season-6-episode-3-highlights-5403278/)
Is MasterChef only for the elite?
Being a popular cooking show that has influenced the food industry in many ways, it is worth noting that it has effects on different people standing in different zones of the power geometry that is being afflicted by MasterChef.
There are a few takeaways to the ‘non-elite’ section of the power geometry:
 MasterChef features a diverse range of contestants from different backgrounds and skill levels. While some of the contestants may have professional culinary experience, others are home cooks or have no formal training. This diversity allows for a broad range of dishes and techniques to be showcased on the show.
The show promotes creativity and experimentation in cooking rather than adhering to a strict set of rules or standards. This means that viewers can take inspiration from the show and adapt the recipes and techniques to their own skill level and budget.
MasterChef has also helped to popularise the "foodie" culture, which emphasizes the enjoyment of food and cooking as a hobby or pastime. This has led to an increased interest in home cooking and a greater appreciation for diverse culinary traditions.
Overall, while MasterChef may not cater to every skill level or budget, it is a show that promotes creativity and experimentation in cooking and has helped to make cooking and food culture more accessible to a wider audience.
 Supporting our sub-question, we can argue the following:
Some of the recipes and ingredients featured on MasterChef may be expensive or difficult to find. For example, the show has featured dishes like foie gras, truffles, and caviar, which are not commonly used in everyday cooking and may be out of reach for many people.
The cooking techniques demonstrated on MasterChef may require specialized equipment or training. For example, contestants on the show have used sous-vide machines, blowtorches, and liquid nitrogen, which are not typically found in home kitchens.
While MasterChef promotes diversity in cuisine and culinary traditions, the show still operates within a certain cultural framework. For example, the show's judges and contestants may be more familiar with Western cuisine, which could make it harder for viewers from other cultural backgrounds to replicate the dishes.


What are cookbooks?

A cookbook is also known as a cookery book. It contains recipes and cooking instructions.These help people to explore and try various food items. They may include photographs or illustrations to help readers recognize the process of cooking while others may include anecdotes from the author which inspires people. Sometimes they also include cultural notes on the dishes they feature. This may include the history of the dish, its cultural significance, and any traditional ingredients used in preparation. For example, a cookbook featuring Indian cuisine may include information on the different spices used in Indian cooking or the role of food in Indian culture. (“Cookbook”)
Cookbooks can be classified based on various factors:
1) By cuisine : whether they are Italian,French,Mexican or chinese
2)By Ingredients : such as vegan,gluten free,dairy free etc.
3)By course : based on appetiser or main course or dessert etc

Are there any differences between the recipes shown on masterChef and on cook books?
Baked Alaska with Genoise Sponge Cake: In MasterChef Season 10,ep 16 contestants were tasked to create their version of "Baked Alaska"(a dessert of sponge cake and ice cream in a meringue covering). "
A recipe for Baked Alaska from "The Joy of Cooking" cookbook by Irma S. Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker, and Ethan Becker (Rombauer and Becker #):
Ingredients:
1 quart ice cream (any flavour)
1/2 cup granulated sugar
4 large egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar.
But contestant Bri Baker's version featured a Genoise sponge cake instead of the traditional sponge cake used in Baked Alaska. The recipe for the Genoise sponge cake is not typically used in traditional Baked Alaska recipes.
Ingredients for Genoise Sponge Cake:
3 large eggs, at room temperature
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup cake flour
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
As you can see, the ingredients for the Genoise Sponge Cake are similar to other sponge cake recipes, and the Baked Alaska recipe uses the traditional ingredients of ice cream, egg whites, cream of tartar, and sugar. The main difference between this recipe and the one featured on MasterChef is the use of a Genoise Sponge Cake, which is a type of sponge cake made with melted butter and a small amount of flour.
\Fried Chicken with Soy Sauce and Honey: In Season 10, Episode 8 of MasterChef, the contestants were tasked with creating their own version of fried chicken. 
Here is a recipe for Fried Chicken from "The Joy of Cooking" cookbook by Irma S. Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker, and Ethan Becker (Rombauer and Becker #) :
Ingredients:
3 to 4 pounds chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, wings, and/or breasts)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
2 large eggs
1/2 cup milk
Vegetable oil, for frying
Contestant Fred Chang's recipe included a marinade made "(To put meat in a mixture of oil,vinegar or wine and spices before cooking,in order to flavour it or make it softer)" with soy sauce and honey, which is not typically used in traditional Southern-style fried chicken recipes.

Difference in effects of MasterChef and cookbooks on individuals and society:
 Entertainment vs Education : The main focus of MasterChef is to provide entertainment by showcasing cooking skills and culinary creativity, whereas cookbooks serve as educational resources that offer step-by-step instructions, recipes, and cooking tips to help individuals enhance and develop their cooking abilities.
Inspiration vs Duplication : While MasterChef can motivate individuals to explore novel ingredients and cooking methods and expand their culinary horizons, cookbooks generally concentrate on replicating established recipes and techniques, offering limited space for innovation and creativity.

Is there any relationship between cookbooks and MasterChef?
Yes, there is a relationship between cookbooks and MasterChef. Cookbooks and MasterChef are connected in several ways beyond just inspiring each other. For example, MasterChef frequently includes challenges where participants are required to prepare dishes from a cookbook or create their own cookbook-worthy recipes. As a result, this has sparked greater enthusiasm in cookbooks and cooking among viewers and enthusiasts of the show, who strive to reproduce the meals they have witnessed on television.
MasterChef has helped to launch the careers of many cookbook authors and celebrity chefs. For example, Gordon Ramsay, who is one of the show's judges. Many of these chefs have gone on to write their own cookbooks, which feature recipes and techniques they developed on the show or in their own culinary careers.
Cookbooks and MasterChef are also related in terms of the skills and knowledge they require. Both cookbooks and MasterChef encourage creativity and experimentation in the kitchen, and both are aimed at helping people become better, more confident cooks. MasterChef has the potential to display the richness of cultural diversity and acquaint viewers with various global cuisines. Similarly, cookbooks can also promote cultural representation by safeguarding and distributing traditional recipes and cooking techniques.
To put it briefly, although cookbooks and MasterChef may not have a direct correlation, they are undoubtedly linked in regards to inspiring, influencing, and necessitating specific abilities and expertise.



Conclusion
Two decades ago, families were cooking using basic recipes and traditions passed down generation after generation. Cut to 2020, we have the same families using recipes prepared in one part of the world, using ingredients from another, and prepared in another. How big a role MasterChef, and its various renditions across the globe, played in order for the world’s kitchens to achieve a global platform is debatable. On one hand, it teaches different recipes, cooking traditions, and culinary expertise from the crème de la crème of the chef fraternity. Utilising the factors of intense competition to keep viewership engaged to the cooking further appreciates the effect. On the other, we do find the portrayal of glamorous inaccessible ingredients and utensils, and exposition of the harsh realities of the industry.
